Why Baby Names???
========================================================
Many expecting parents spend days deliberating on what's a "good" name for their baby. The criteria for this differs from person to person but most people like traditional names that are not too common. By using this applet, parents can see the most popular names for any given year and see how it trends with time.

Another potential use is for people to link noticeable peaks and valleys in a name's popularity with pop culture events.

Data

The data was downloaded and pre-processed into a useful format using R and a px package.
